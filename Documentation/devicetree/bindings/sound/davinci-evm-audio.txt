* Texas Instruments SoC audio setups with TLV320AIC3X Codec

Required properties:
- compatible : "ti,davinci-evm-audio"
- ti,model : The user-visible name of this sound complex.
- ti,audio-routing : A list of the connections between audio components.
  Each entry is a pair of strings, the first being the connection's sink,
  the second being the connection's source. Valid names for sources and
  sinks are the codec's pins, and the jacks on the board:

  Codec pins:

  * MIC3L
  * MIC3R
  * LINE1L
  * LINE2L
  * LINE1R
  * LINE2R

  Board connectors:

  * Headphone Jack
  * Line Out
  * Mic Jack

- ti,mcasp-controller : The phandle of the McASP controller
- ti,audio-codec : The phandle of the TLV320AIC3x audio codec
- ti,codec-clock-rate : The Codec Clock rate (in Hz) applied to the Codec

- dai-data		: A list of DAI data used by SOC code to register
			  DAI, Codecs platform.
			  The string index "should" be as shown below.
dai-data =
"<DAI Name>", 		"<DAI Stream Name>",
"<CODEC DAI Name>",	"<true if evm_aic3x_init is required, else false>",
"<evm ops required (evm_ops or evm_spdif_ops)>";

Here fields
"<DAI Name>"		: used to indicate the DAI Name
"<DAI Stream Name>"	: used to indicate the Stream Name
"<CODEC DAI Name>"	: used to bind the link between Codec DAI and ASOC DAI

Machine related options
"<true/false>"		: Whether the machine specific initialization
			: evm_aic3x_init() is required

"<evm ops required>"	: Which hardware ops function is to be used.
			: (evm_ops or evm_spdif_ops)


Example:

sound {
	compatible = "ti,davinci-evm-audio";
	ti,model = "DA830 EVM";
	ti,audio-codec = <&tlv320aic3x>;
	ti,mcasp-controller = <&mcasp1>;
	ti,codec-clock-rate = <12000000>;
	dai-data =
		"TLV320AIC3X", 		"AIC3X",
		"tlv320aic3x-hifi",	"true",
		"evm-ops";
};
